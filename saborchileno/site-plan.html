      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>We will soon open a Chilean home style restaurant in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.  
          We will bring the greatest taste of Chile to this beautiful country.  We will decorate the restaurant in a familiar, warm and friendly way. 
          The attention will be in charge of friendly and smiling Chileans.  The menu will be composed of typical Chilean food.  
          Breakfast, lunch and dinner will be served.  There will be Chilean music in the background, in a pleasant and soft tone.  
          Canada is a multicultural country, because of all the immigrants that arrive every year. 
          Would you like to find in this beautiful country a delicious "empanada chilena", "pastel de choclo" or a typical "cazuela chilena"?  
          That and much more is exactly what you can taste in our restaurant. We invite you to learn more about us on our website, see you soon.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Canada is a multicultural country, with a tradition of acceptance of cultures from different countries around the world.  
          In addition, it is very common for families to eat out frequently.  With these characteristics, we will soon open a Chilean food restaurant 
          oriented to offer the delicious traditional food of my country to consumers of all ages in the city of Regina in the province of Saskatchewan.  
          Among the dishes we will offer are the delicious "cazuela chilena", "pastel de choclo" and the traditional "empanada chilena".
