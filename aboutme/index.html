      <h2>Sam</h2>
      <p>Hi everybody, I am Samuel, but you can call me Sam, I am from Chile, I am 48 years old, I am married with Carolina, we have 3 children
          Tammy, Alan and Marcelo, and 1 grand children Agustin.
      </p>
      <p>I finished Pathway in March 2022, that was awesome and great experience.  I am very exited to start a Bachelor Degree with my age.  I will give my best to achieve it.</p>
      <p>I am an accountant but I love programming, so I started my degree in Applied Technology.</p>
      <p>I am a converse since 1997.  A couple of missionaries knocked my door and shared the Gospel with my wife and me.  We feel the Holy Ghost and accept the Gospel message.  
          We really love the church and over all our Savior.</p>
